## current problem notes and comments.

### Noticed bugs / improvements:
Intra part gap default - 0 is fine. looks more compact. or not... keep thinking
Mode badge - color coding. Blue - Command, Green - Input, Grey (as now) - View


## how commands should work in the command / filter:

- General syntax:
(filter) :command_name -parameters
e.g.
t + r10 :export -json
t'AI...' :tchange 
- last command is to change the topic of all filtered messages to the current topic (selected in input box topic selector)
filter:command (Enter to apply)
