## current tasks, notes and comments. scope for the next release.

Next release focus - accurate context assembly, performance optimization, debugging/tracking tools/infrastructure via localStorage.

Raw problems:
1. UI: context boundary rendering - via DOM mutation (performace impact). Marking of off-context messages (color dimming - to settings, badge)  
2. Attachments - only included from the current request. Not all history
3. Messages with variants marking
5. dbg_pipeline_presend - include: token coun (system, user, history), message_count, attachments count.
