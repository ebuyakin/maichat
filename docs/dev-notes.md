## current problem notes and comments.

### pre-release:


#### initialization for new users:
1. tutorial [x]
2. model catalogue - usage limits defaults? [x]
3. default settings - double check they match my current settings [x]
4. default topic tree - prepare initial topic tree for new users
5. first message / greeting.
6. Double check keyboard reference / F1 help - to make sure they reflect the latest changes.

#### code polish:
1. remove debug code
2. readme, changelog - consider this the first real public beta.

#### push/production/release steps:
- publish on github pages (as current version) - generally should work automatically after push
- launch on vercel

2. discoverability of the app.
