## current problme notes and comments.

Filtering language. comments:

1. hangling quotes and escapes - I don't think it's high priority. we can limit the topic naming with just letters numbers and white spaces and excplicitly prohibit using punctuation. That will simplify filtering language and filtering handling, I believe
2. We need to add one more command e - for messges with errors (given what we just implemented)
3. I think it would be useful to have 'default' filters by current topic and current model (ie topic and/or model selected in the input area) - I would suggest plain t and plain m as commands for filtering by current topic/model. - or I think it's in specs already.
4.
