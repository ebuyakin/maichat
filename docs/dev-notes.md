## current problem notes and comments.

Radical change of approach...

1. After some practice with the current version I came to conclusion that the approach that is taken to the presentation of the messages is not the best one. The idea of __partitioning__ of the messages was a good one and it allows a very comfortable navigation between the parts of the messages using only a small number of keys (so the user never needs to move their hands off the keyboard), but it causes problems when the assistant response (or user request potentially) have some formatted text, like code, markdown, potentially images etc. In this scenario partitioning of the messages makes the presentation of the messages inferior and requires extra steps (key presses) to access the message content. So, after some thinking I'm inclined to try a different approach:
- the message (either user request or assistant response) is presented as one uninterrupted fragment of text with embedded code snippets, markdown, tables, potentially images (formatted accordingly). There is no partitioning any more and now message parts as focusable units. We manipulate the presentation of the message history (ie the visible part) by using scrolling position. The scrolling remains discrete and controlled by the same keys (j/k, g/G and possible u/d). The scrolling step is configured by the user in settings. Now, the 'focused part' that was a key element that we target with scrolling is replaced with 'focused fragment' of the whole message. Here is how it should work:
On open/reload the user gets into default Input mode (the modal character remains untouchd). The message history is scrolled to the end, so the last message is anchored to the bottom (last line of the last message is at outerGap distance from the border of the usablePane). Say, the scrolling step is set to be 10 lines (or corresponding fraction of the viewport - TBD, which one is more convenient). When user press Esc in Input mode and switches to the View mode the last 10 lines of the last message get highlighted (TBD how). Then on k press, the lines 10-19 get higlighted, then 0-10. So it's similar to the navigation between the message parts (in the current version), but just without the parts (so the text is not interrupted). When the user reaches the first fragment of the message and press k from there, it moves to the user request. If the user request exceeds the scrolling step (say it's 15 lines), then the last 10 lines get highligted, and on next k the remaining 5 lines get higlighted etc.. next k moves to the previous assistant message and the process repeats itself. Generally the idea is to preserve discrete srcolling and anchoring (!), but remove splitting messages into parts, so we can maintain their embedded content displayed in the main window without interrupting them by parts borders. The anchoring still should work in the same manner as now. When highlighted fragment achieves the top edge of the viewport, it starts scrolling and remains at the top. If the user changes the direction and moves down with j, no scrolling happens until the highlighted fragment is at the bottom.

2.I've read your notes carefully, Eugene. You're experiencing a fundamental tension between two design goals:

1. **Discrete, keyboard-driven navigation** (the partitioning system)
2. **Preserving content integrity** (code, equations, markdown displayed inline)

Let me make sure I understand your proposed solution before we discuss it further:

## Your New Vision (as I understand it)

Instead of splitting messages into fixed-size parts, you want to:
- Keep messages whole and uninterrupted
- Use a "sliding highlight window" that moves through the message in steps (e.g., 10 lines)
- Maintain the same keyboard navigation (j/k) but now it moves this highlight window
- When the highlight reaches message boundaries, it jumps to the next/previous message

## Key Questions to Clarify

1. **Visual Feedback**: When you say "highlighted fragment" - are you thinking of:
   - A subtle background color for those 10 lines?
   - A border/frame around the fragment?
   - Just a visual indicator in the margin?

2. **Code Blocks**: In the new approach, would a code block that spans 30 lines:
   - Be visible entirely when any part is highlighted?
   - Or only the portion within the current 10-line window?

3. **Anchoring Behavior**: Currently, parts anchor to top/bottom edges. With fragments, should:
   - The first line of the fragment anchor to the top?
   - Or the middle of the fragment stay centered?

4. **Mixed Content**: If lines 5-15 contain a code block, but your window is lines 1-10, how should this render?

What aspects feel most important to get right first? 

1. Visual feedback - I'd suggest some gutter line (replacing the current blue border) on the left-hand side of the highlighted fragment. The background changes is probably too much and the border/frame would again be visually interrupting the message (and that's what I'm trying to avoid)
2. It depends. let me give you an example... Say the message is 60 lines, the screen is 40 lines and the code block occupies from 15 to 45 lines. So when the last fragment (last 10 lines) is anchored to the bottom, there are 4 out of 6 fragments on the screen and the first two fragmenta (0-20) are hidden above the top edge. The code 15-45 lines are all on the screen and visible. I do k, - no scrolling happens, the highligted fragment is changes, it's now 30-40 lines, the code is still on the screen. I do k press 2 more times and now 20-30 lines are highlighted (and that is the top of the screen part) - so far there is still no scrolling. And the sreen remains the same as at the beginning, only the gutter indicator moved up. Now, the next k, does scroll the history. Now, the screen shows lines 10-50, the last fragment (50-60) is hidden below the bottom edge and the first fragment (0-10) is hidden above the top edge.  The code fragment is still visible.  And the highligted fragment is 10-20. The next k - now the screen has lines 0-40, 0-10 - highlighted, 40-60 hidden downstairs, and part of the code fragment is hidden as well (only 15-40 lines contain code and last 5 lines of code are hidden.)
Now if I continue with k, i get the last fragment (if there are more than one) of the user request highlighted and positioned at the top of the screen.(and meta part remains between the user and assistant parts as it is now).
If, however, I change direction and do j key, the highlighted fragment will be again 10-20 (but there is no scrolling, so the screen still shows 0-40 lines). I repest j 3 more times, still 0-40 lines are on the screen, but 30-40 is highlighted, next j - scroll to 10-50 with 40-50 highlighted. - hope you get the idea. otherwise shoot me with the questions.
3. Anchoring: when top anchored - top line of the fragment anchored to the top edge (with outerGap), when bottom anchored - last line of the fragment anchored to the bottom edge (with outerGap). in reading regime - middle line anchored in the middle of the screen. Essentially all the same is now, just instead of the parts we operate with the visually uninterrupted fragments of the message (playing the same role as parts play now)
4. If the code block exceeds the fragment size (=scrolling step) it gets highlighted section by section... E.g. fragment size is 10 and for simplicity the message contains only the code and it occupies lines 0-70 (window still 40 lines).  Then on open I see lines 30-70 on the screen and 60-70 lines are highlighted... and then as in case of the regular text on k the highlighted fragment moves in steps to 50-60, 40-50,30-40, then the screen scrolls to 20-60 (with 20-30 fragment highlighted) etc. Essentially no difference in treatment between the code (or any embedded content) and the regular text.

Thank you for the detailed explanation, Eugene. I understand your vision now - you want to preserve the keyboard-driven discrete navigation but eliminate the artificial message breaks that interfere with content integrity. This is actually quite elegant.

Let me confirm my understanding with a few clarifying questions:

## 1. Fragment Boundaries & Code Blocks

When a fragment boundary cuts through a code block (e.g., fragment is lines 20-30 but code spans 25-35), should:
- The gutter indicator span exactly lines 20-30 (visually cutting through the code)?
- Or should the code block's visual frame remain intact while only the gutter shows the fragment position?

## 2. Copy/Action Operations

Currently, you can copy a "part" with `y`. With fragments:
- Should `y` copy the currently highlighted fragment (those 10 lines)?
- Or copy the entire message the fragment belongs to?
- Would you want a new key for "copy whole message"?

## 3. Fragment Size & Small Messages

If a message is only 3 lines and fragment size is 10:
- Does the highlight cover just those 3 lines?
- Or does it extend the full 10 lines (partially into the next message)?

## 4. Overlay Triggers (v, m keys)

Currently these work on the "active part". Should they now:
- Work if the highlighted fragment contains any code/equation?
- Or only if the fragment start/end aligns with code boundaries?
- Or should we keep the overlay system as-is (showing all code blocks from the message)?

## 5. Implementation Priority

What's most critical to test first:
- Just the navigation/scrolling behavior?
- Or do we need to solve inline rendering (code/equations) simultaneously?


1. The gutter indicator span exactly lines 20-30 - yes. the highlighting shall not depend on the content, only on the geometry (size) of the message. if the message has no integer number of fragments, the last fragment size shall be adjusted... e.g. the message 35 lines - 10-10-10-5 (and we probably should allow +1/+2 line to avoid too small fragments.. e.g. 32 lines - 10-10-12). "visually cutting through the code" - it won't visually cut through the code as we won't have frames, but only a side gutter, the code fragment may not be displayed in full (but that's inevitable if it's long enough)
2. I don't think there is a need for copying highlighted fragments as they have no semantic meaning (it's just geometry for comfortable reading). We may want, however, to preserve current v1, v2... keys for copying embedded content (like code snippets) as they do have semantic meaning and that may be useful for the user.
3. If the message is less than fragment size, then it's highlighted as one unit (no matter its size - 1 line, 2 lines ...) So we preserve message-by-message navigation, but we also allow partial navigation for large messages - again this is exactly the same idea as we message partitioning, just without actual breaking the message into separate elements in html (parts).
4. specifically v,m - shall be redefined...  we may not need them at all, as the code snippet will be visible, so no need to open it in a separate overlay, right? TBD. most of the keys work on the message, not on the part! Do you know what keys work on parts?
5. This is a good quesiton. We need to develop the implementation plan and I actually have a couple of more comments here.
