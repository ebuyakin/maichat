# Settings Refactoring Complete - Schema-Driven Architecture

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive settings refactoring with schema-driven architecture, 
eliminating code duplication and establishing single source of truth for all 
application settings.

## Changes

### Phase 2: Implement Schema (Foundation)
- Created `src/core/settings/schema.js` with complete settings definition
- 22 active settings with metadata (defaultValue, renderAction, control, ui)
- Auto-generated: DEFAULTS, REBUILD_KEYS, RESTYLE_KEYS, IGNORE_KEYS
- Updated `src/core/settings/index.js` to use schema-generated DEFAULTS

### Phase 3: Update renderPolicy
- Replaced hardcoded key lists with schema imports
- Reduced renderPolicy.js from 73 to 36 lines (-51%)
- All render actions now auto-synced with schema
- Settings changes now take effect immediately

### Phase 4: Clean Up Legacy Settings
- Removed 8 unused legacy settings:
  - Fade system: fadeMode, fadeHiddenOpacity, fadeInMs, fadeOutMs, fadeTransitionMs
  - Partition system: partFraction, partPadding
  - Unused: showTrimNotice
- Added automatic migration to clean legacy keys from localStorage
- Removed visibility tab, moved useInlineFormatting to spacing tab
- Updated form to 3 tabs: spacing, scroll, context
- Added missing controls: assumedUserTokens, topicOrderMode

### Phase 5: Hybrid Form Generation
- Auto-generate form controls from schema while preserving styling
- Reduced ~90 lines of repetitive HTML to 3 lines
- Control generation supports: number inputs, checkboxes, select dropdowns
- All structure, CSS, keyboard shortcuts, and behavior preserved

### UI Improvements
- Removed redundant fieldsets and legends (cleaner layout)
- Fixed checkbox layout (checkbox + label on same line)
- Increased settings-body padding (16px → 25px)
- Added spacing between controls (6px regular, 12px checkboxes)
- Made hints full-width and left-aligned
- Consistent styling across all tabs

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to schema.js and settings/index.js
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md with settings architecture details
- Created settings_refactoring.md with complete refactoring plan
- Created phase5-complete.md with summary and testing checklist

## Benefits

### Achieved
✅ Single source of truth - all settings defined once in schema
✅ DRY principle - no duplication of definitions
✅ Maintainability - add setting in one place, everything updates
✅ Auto-sync - renderPolicy, forms, defaults always match
✅ Type safety - constraints (min/max/step) from schema
✅ Immediate effect - settings changes work without reload
✅ Cleaner codebase - 150+ lines removed
✅ Better UX - cleaner overlay, better spacing, fixed checkboxes

### Adding New Setting - Before vs After
**Before:** Edit 5+ places (DEFAULTS, renderPolicy, HTML, readFormValues, populateFormFromSettings)
**After:** Add to SETTINGS_SCHEMA - done! ✅

## Files Changed
- src/core/settings/schema.js (NEW)
- src/core/settings/index.js (refactored)
- src/runtime/renderPolicy.js (refactored)
- src/features/config/settingsOverlay.js (refactored)
- src/styles/components/config.css (improved)
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (updated)
- docs/settings_refactoring.md (NEW)
- docs/phase5-complete.md (NEW)

## Testing
- All 22 settings visible and functional
- Settings changes take effect immediately
- localStorage migration works (legacy keys removed)
- Form controls auto-generated correctly
- All styling preserved
- All keyboard shortcuts work
- No errors

## Migration
Users' localStorage will be automatically cleaned of legacy keys on next app load.
No user action required.
