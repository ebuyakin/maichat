You've made a good observation regarding the exponential distribution's Probability Density Function (PDF)!

1.  **$f(0; \lambda) = \lambda$**: Yes, for the exponential distribution's PDF, $f(x; \lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$, if you substitute $x=0$, you get $f(0; \lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda \cdot 0} = \lambda e^0 = \lambda \cdot 1 = \lambda$. So, the peak of the probability density occurs at $x=0$.

2.  **Monotonicity**: You are also correct that the exponential PDF is a monotonically decreasing function for all $x \geq 0$. Since $\lambda > 0$, the term $e^{-\lambda x}$ decreases as $x$ increases, meaning $f(x; \lambda)$ also decreases as $x$ increases.

However, your interpretation that "the probability of a longer interval between events is always smaller than the probability of a shorter interval" needs a slight clarification. While the *probability density* at a longer time $x$ is indeed smaller than at a shorter time $x'$, this does not directly imply that the *probability* of any longer *interval* is always smaller than any shorter *interval*.

Here's why:

*   **Probability Density vs. Probability**: The PDF, $f(x)$, represents probability *density*, not probability itself. For a continuous random variable, the probability of observing any *exact* specific value of $x$ is technically zero. Probabilities are found by integrating the PDF over an interval. That is, $P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f(x) dx$.

*   **Interpreting the Decreasing PDF**: What the decreasing PDF *does* mean is that events that occur *sooner* (i.e., shorter waiting times) have a higher *likelihood* or *density* of occurrence than events that occur much later. For example, the likelihood of an event happening exactly at $x=1$ is higher than the likelihood of it happening exactly at $x=5$.

*   **Comparing Intervals**: When comparing probabilities of intervals, the length of the interval matters. For instance, the probability of an event occurring in the interval $$ (a shorter interval starting at 0) will generally be higher than the probability of it occurring in $$ (a shorter interval starting later). However, it's not necessarily true that *any* longer interval has a smaller probability than *any* shorter interval. For example, the probability of $P(X \in)$ might be smaller than $P(X \in)$ even though $$ is a longer interval, because the latter encompasses more of the distribution.

In essence, the decreasing nature of the PDF tells us that the "concentration" of probability is higher for smaller values of $x$. This is a defining characteristic of waiting time distributions where shorter waiting times are more common.
