I want to invite you to work with me on MaiChat project. The project is work in progress and significant part of the application has already been implemented. Your task is to study project documentation carefully and try to understand and assess the project. Ask questions if you're not sure that the documentation is clear (some docs may miss something). Give me a summary of how you understand the project and what you think of it. I'm interested to hear your honest opinion about it merits and shortcomings.
Study the source code very carefully, try to understand the components and the dependencies. Give me a thorough review of the architecture of the product and what needs to be improved. Recently the progress was slow and fixing some issues only generated new problems, so it feels like we're stuck in the place and not moving forward. Let me know if you're ready to help and what way forward would you suggest.
